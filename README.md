Industry*:
Earth

Project Title*:
Smart Irrigation System

Problem Statement/Opportunity*:
The project provides following Solutions: 1) Technical advancement in the field of agriculture. 2) Monitoring Temperature and Humidity of the Field 3) Reduction in the effort of farmers.

Project Description*:
Smart farming is a management concept focused on providing the agricultural industry with the infrastructure to leverage advanced technology – including the cloud and the internet of things (IoT) – for tracking, monitoring, automating and analyzing operations. Also known as precision agriculture, smart farming is software-managed and sensor-monitored. Soil moisture information plays an important role in environmental monitoring, agricultural production and hydrological studies. Particularly, agricultural yield depends on several growing parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture and pH of the soil, etc. The objective of this project is to design a simple, easy methodology to monitor and indicate the level of soil moisture, temperature and humidity levels that are continuously controlled in order to achieve maximum plant growth and simultaneously optimize and the monitor the sensor data using Azure Services. In order to replace expensive controllers in current available systems, the NodeMCU will be used in this project as it is an affordable microcontroller. The NodeMCU will analyze signals from sensors such as temperature, humidity, etc. The Project uses IoT Central Application, Azure Services and IoT Central Hub Services. The data from nodemcu is transferred to IoT Central Application via the IoT Central Hub and then the data is displayed in the form of graphs which can be accessed by IoT Central Application accounts of the azure services and the user can easily view or monitor the field parameters.

Primary Azure Technology*:
Azure IoT Central, Azure IoT Hub, Azure Resource Manager
